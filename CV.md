While at [Syracuse University](https://physics.syr.edu) and a [Cardiff
University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/), my research focused
on analyzing gravitational-wave data from the [Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)](https://www.ligo.org/).  
I worked on a variety of aspects of data analysis, including the
[identification of gravitational waves from merging binary
systems](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016CQGra..33u5004U/abstract).

At [UChicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu), I decided to move from the
dark side to the light and began my research in optical spectroscopy.
I have analyzed stellar streams as part of the [Southern Stellar Stream
Spectroscopic Survey (S<sup>5</sup> Collaboration)](https://s5collab.github.io/).
As part of my research, I have:
 - performed the first high-resolution analysis of the [300S globular cluster
stellar
stream](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.529.2413U/abstract).
 - worked with then-[OSU](https://astronomy.osu.edu/) undergrad [Kaia
Atzberger](https://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/kaia-atzberger) on the [Leiptr
stellar stream](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241017312A/abstract), 
which we found to be the least massive disrupted dwarf galaxy identified
to-date.
 - researched GD-1 stellar stream with
[ASU](https://sese.asu.edu/research/focus-areas/cosmology-astronomy-astrophysics)
undergrad [Naomi Carl](https://naomicarl.wordpress.com/), which will be
presented in our forthcoming paper, and
 - performed the first high-resolution chemical analysis of the most metal-poor
   globular cluster in our galaxy, ESO 280-SC06, which will be described in my
forthcoming paper.
