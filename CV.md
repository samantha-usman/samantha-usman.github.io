My research is primarily focused on spectroscopy of galactic halo stars.
I previously worked on gravitational waves, specifically from binary systems.

I currently hold an MPhil in Physics and Astronomy from [Cardiff
University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/physics-astronomy) and a BS in
Physics and Math (double major) with a French minor from
[Syracuse University](https://thecollege.syr.edu/physics/).

I have previously had internships at [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov),
[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard), [Caltech](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/)
and the [Linear Particle Accelerator of
Orsay](https://a2c.ijclab.in2p3.fr/en/a2c-home-en/gw-home-en/gw-virgo-2/).
