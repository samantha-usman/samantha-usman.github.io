I'm involved in several outreach programs.  In particular, I am passionate
about an inclusive community and support for LGBT+ scientists.

## UChicago+
During the pandemic, I created a messaging group aimed at queer UChicago
students to make connections during lockdown.  The group has now grown into
[UChicago+](https://blueprint.uchicago.edu/organization/uchicagoplus) (also
written as *UChicago Plus*), a recognized student group (QGroup) under the
Center for Identity & Inclusion and a registered student organisation (RSO)
recognized and supported by the University of Chicago.

As of writing, UChicago+ has nearly five hundred members and dozens of events.
We are the largest LGBT+ student group at the University of Chicago, and we
provide a venue for students across campus to connect and feel welcomed,
especially during turbulent times.

As the founder and president of the largest LGBT+ student group on campus,
I, and several other members of my organization, meet regularly with university
administrators to advocate for the needs of LGBT+ students on campus, including
providing LGBT+ and international students alternative housing during summer
and winter breaks and ensuring proper medical and mental healthcare is
available to all students.

For my work, I have been recognized with the LGBT+ Community Engagement Award
from the UChicago Alumni Pride Association and UChicago Center for Sexuality
and Gender Studies and the Out to Innovate Scholarship from the Out to Innovate
(formerly the National Organisation of Gay and Lesbian Science and Technical
Professionals, *NOGLSTP*).

## Mentorship
I have mentored five students through the Women in Physics Mentorship Program
and the graduate student mentorship program run by the Physical Sciences
Division's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office. Mentorship involved checking
on students, giving advice on academic progress and career path, as well as
resources and support for coming out in the workplace.

I have additionally mentored two undergraduate women during summer research
projects as part of the [Leadership
Alliance](https://leadershipalliance.uchicago.edu/). To learn more about the
research I did with my students, head to my [CV page](CV.md). 

## LGBT in STEM Recognition Events
I've participated in several events that shined a light on LGBT+ scientists.

### Out in STEM
Hosted by the Physical Sciences Division's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Office, I gave a brief interview and discussed my experiences as a queer
scientist and was highlighted along with other LGBT and ally colleagues.

### International LGBT+ in STEM Day, 2018
While doing my Masters at Cardiff University, I organized an event celebrating
International LGBT+ in STEM Day. I coordinated with Enfys, the Cardiff
University's LGBT network, to secure funding and location to host a 50-person
event. I also invited two speakers to come and discuss their experiences in the
LGBT community.
