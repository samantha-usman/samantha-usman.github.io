I am an astrophysics PhD candidate at the [University of
Chicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu) and an [American Dissertation
Fellow](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/news/article/samantha-usman-has-been-awarded-the-aauw-american-dissertation-fellowship/) through the American Association for University Women (AAUW).

I will be defending my thesis titled *Probing Multiple Populations in
Globular Clusters Using Stellar Streams* on May 16th, 2025. 
Please contact me via email if you would like to join via Zoom!

I'm currently looking for a postdoc!
If you or someone you know is looking for a postdoctoral research specializing
in spectral analysis of stellar populations, please contact me and let me know.
