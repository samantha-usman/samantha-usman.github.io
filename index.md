I am a Visiting Assistant Faculty in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy
at Colgate
University](https://www.colgate.edu/academics/departments-programs/department-physics-and-astronomy) for the 2025-2026 academic year.

I recently defended my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the [University of
Chicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu), where I was an [American Dissertation
Fellow](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/news/article/samantha-usman-has-been-awarded-the-aauw-american-dissertation-fellowship/) through the American Association for University Women (AAUW).

I defended my thesis titled *Probing Multiple Populations in
Globular Clusters Using Stellar Streams* on May 16th, 2025. 
Please contact me via email if you would like to watch the recording on YouTube.

I'm currently looking for a postdoc!
If you or someone you know is looking for a postdoctoral research specializing
in spectral analysis of stellar populations, please contact me and let me know.
