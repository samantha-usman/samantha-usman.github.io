I am an astrophysics PhD candidate at the [University of
Chicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu).
I will be defending my thesis titled <it>Probing Multiple Populations in
Globular Clusters Using Stellar Streams</it> on May 16th, 2025.  
Please contact me via email if you would like to join via Zoom!

I'm currently looking for a postdoc!
If you or someone you know is looking for a postdoctoral research specializing
in spectral analysis of stellar populations, please contact me and let me know.
