# Chemical Abundances in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster ESO 280-SC06: A Formerly Massive, Tidally Disrupted Globular Cluster

I recently published a new paper in the Open Journal of Astrophysics!<\br>
In this work, we observe and chemically tag ten stars in the most metal-poor intact globular cluster in our galaxy, ESO 280-SC06.
We were specifically looking for "second-population" stars which contain a unique chemical imprint found only in globular clusters: enrichment in elements such as aluminum and sodium, and depletion in elements such as oxygen and magnesium.

We found the cluster has a 8 of the 10 observed stars were second-population, significantly higher than would be expected for a cluster of this mass, even when accounting for its initial mass and significant mass loss.

We suggest this is due to preferential stripping of first-population stars, as ESO 280-SC06 has lost (by my calculations) more than 95% of its stars.
Since second-population stars are often concentrated towards the center of clusters, tidal forces would be more likely to rip away the first-population if the cluster hasn't sufficiently mixed.

Does this sound confusing? Send me an email for more clarification, or read the full paper on the [Open Journal of Astrophysics](https://astro.theoj.org/article/141756-chemical-abundances-in-the-metal-poor-globular-cluster-eso-280-sc06-a-formerly-massive-tidally-disrupted-globular-cluster).


# Chemical Abundances in the Leiptr Stellar Stream: A Disrupted Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy?

In addition to my paper on the intact globular cluster, a student that I mentored with my advisor Prof. Alex Ji published her first first-author paper earlier this year!
In it, she analyzed four stars that I had observed in the Leiptr stellar stream.
Based on the clusters metallicity dispersion and heavy metal enrichment, we determine that Leiptr is *the smallest disrupted dwarf galaxy identified to-date!*
